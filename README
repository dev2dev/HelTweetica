About HelTweetica

HelTweetica is an iPad app that uses xAuth (OAuth variant) and JSON to read, star, retweet, and post tweets from multiple Twitter accounts.

----------

How to build HelTweetica

Before you can build this project, you need to have your own OAuth Consumer Key and Consumer Secret, which you can get from Twitter:

http://twitter.com/oauth_clients/new

You will also want to use the xAuth authentication method (which bypasses the usual OAuth practice of requiring users to auth through a web browser), which requires sending an email to Twitter making the request:

http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method:-oauth-access_token-for-xAuth

Then in Twitter.m, put your key and secret in:

#define kConsumerKey @"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
#define kConsumerSecret @"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
